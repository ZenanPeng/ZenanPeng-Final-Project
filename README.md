## 4501 - Final Project 

**Description**

This project is designed to analyze the different relationships among the data, including Yellow Taxi rides data, Uber sample rides data, and the weather data in NYC area, and taxi_zones.shp. In Preprocessing Data, Storing Data, Understanding Data, and Visualizaing Data, we have used many third-party libraries that will be clearly mentioned in requirement.txt file, especially pandas, sqlalchemy, and matplotlib.pyplot. In particular, this project starts from scraping data by the NYC Yellow Taxi website, then to cleaning data based on different criteria, building database, writing SQL queries to get desired data, and finally producing intuitional visualization plots so that we can manipulate data and obtain information from them. All related codes are in the file Project.ipynb.
