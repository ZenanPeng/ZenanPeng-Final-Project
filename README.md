
**Description**

This project is designed to analyze the different relationships among the Yellow Taxi rides, the Uber rides, and the weather in NYC area. Through
four parts, including Preprocessing Data, Storing Data, Understanding Data, and Visualizaing Data, we have used many third-party libraries that will be
clearly mentioned in requirement.txt file, especially pandas, sqlalchemy, and matplotlib.pyplot. In particular, this project starts from scraping data
from online url, then to cleaning data based on different criteria, building database, writing SQL queries to get desired data, and finally producing
intuitional visualization plots so that we can manipulate data and obtain information from them.
